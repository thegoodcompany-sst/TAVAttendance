# Release ledger

This is the source draft for mobile release notes. Keep completed changes under
`Unreleased`; the `release` skill audits them against Git before each release.

## Unreleased

- Added atomic student creation with mandatory consent attestation across web,
  iOS, and Android; direct student inserts and consent-ledger mutations are now
  blocked.
- Hardened tutor grade access, Study Space report/export exclusion, account
  invitation privileges, and App Intent kiosk authorization.
- Removed student identifiers from push notifications, analytics error details,
  and successfully synced Android offline-attendance cache entries.
- Explicit erase/anonymise flows now delete student photos and result slips from
  Storage before removing database data; scheduled orphan cleanup remains
  tracked separately.
- Added regression coverage for kiosk App Intent authorization, analytics
  redaction, and Android offline-cache cleanup.
- Release preparation now reports changes since the prior build and requires an
  explicit user-selected marketing version before any release mutation.

## 1.1 — 2026-07-16

- Added opt-in biometric app unlock on iOS and Android, including Face ID or
  fingerprint protection for kiosk administration.
